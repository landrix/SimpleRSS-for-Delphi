Another update to the interface for the downloads to try and make it cleaner (it still seems cluttered to me), and a bunch of admin things and working on some SimpleRSS stuff this weekend (a few examples and a secret project).&lt;Br/>
This week is really the OMG week of my life (or atleast this year). To start it off Borland got it's RSS going a bit more that before and they have it on there site (check it out at &lt;A href="http://dotnet.borland.com/rss/">http://dotnet.borland.com/rss/&lt;/a>. What made that an OMG moment is John Kastor from Borland a was taking feed back from the community (including a lot from me) about it. Most companies now days don't.&lt;br/>
Next up was the announcement that a 4 top people from Borland were leaving :(&lt;br/> This has sparked a huge debate about it which I am loving (see &lt;a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&amp;ixPost=105252&amp;ixReplies=17">http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&amp;ixPost=105252&amp;ixReplies=17&lt;/a>)&lt;br/>
But the most OMG moment of this week happened this very morning and it was that Justin Frankel (from Nullsoft the makers of WinAmp) has quit. Yip, he is gone from WinAmp which is a huge shame. What I am really glad about is this will give him freedom (away from AOL) that he deserves so much to develop the great programs he has in his head.&lt;br/></description><author>Robert MacLean &lt;robert@sadev.co.za></author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.sadev.co.za/viewblog?id={160C219E-744D-D811-95C5-0020ED3788F5}</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2004 09:20:27 GMT+2</pubDate></item>

What I am doing now is moving the data across. I have 2 or 3 articles to move across, the entire gallery and downloads and any new blog entries since November (like this one). And then it is done :D&lt;Br/>One nice feature of the blog on the site (besides the l33t [edit: l33t is more l33t than leet] rss feed), is now it only shows the latest 10 entries.

Anyway the new site is still coming. It was going to use PHP-Nuke, until the db got toasted at which point I decided to rather write my own system. The front end is done, including RSS feeds powered by simple rss 0.2 (see &lt;a href="http://sf.net/projects/simplerss">http://sf.net/projects/simplerss&lt;/a>).
The backend is almost done (probebly 2-5 days more work and then I'll get it uploaded and sleep for a bit. Seems the new site really wants to be up on the 1 year birthday of this site (despite what I  want).&lt;br/>
Oh, and if any clients at my day job are reading....please I beg you do not work tonight, it's the company xmas party and I doubt you want someone to drive from that to fix your server (might be alright though, you know it's don't drink and drive, not don't drink and re-install os's).</description><author>Robert MacLean &lt;robert@sadev.co.za></author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.sadev.co.za/viewblog?id={B6FBF873-E639-D811-900E-A78CA70DD662}</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2003 00:00:00 GMT+2</pubDate></item>

In a sense they are symbolic links that *nix has had for years, but not as powerful.&lt;Br/>
There main drawback is that they can only exist on the same drive (ie you can not have then across drives).&lt;Br/>
Again on the plus, there is is the simplicty to use. In Delphi simply have: &lt;Br/>CreateHardLink(NewFile:String,ExistingFile:String,nil);
Example:&lt;p/>

createhardlink('c:newfile.txt','c:oldfile.txt',nil);&lt;Br/>
To remove a hard link, just use the normal file delete methods.</description><author>Robert MacLean &lt;robert@sadev.co.za></author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.sadev.co.za/viewblog?id={22B6308D-942D-D811-81BE-C3D1CAC68954}</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2003 00:00:01 GMT+2</pubDate></item>

The new site will also have all the downloads I listed here in my blog (like the finger program) added to the downloads section, and a whole bunch of new photos.&lt;Br/>
Lastly my blog is going to become more programming/web centered and less about me. So in light of that news, there is a new version of InnoSetup available from http://www.jrsoftware.org.&lt;Br/>
Innosetup is a great, free tools (esp for delphi/pascal developers) for generating install programs.</description><author>Robert MacLean &lt;robert@sadev.co.za></author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.sadev.co.za/viewblog?id={4433795A-942D-D811-95AF-9EB035302CB7}</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2003 00:00:01 GMT+2</pubDate></item>

If all pans out over the next 2 weeks, sadev should be going to a new home and then I can do the site upgrade (it's been on hold because of the possible move).&lt;Br/>
Oh, well my life is terribly boring right now so I will leave you to go and follow the HalfLife 2 theft, which is a lot more interesting.&lt;Br/>

Me and Janine are getting a 2 bedroom flat which is really cool. I'm going to be having a big old lan there as well (terrify the neighbours).&lt;br/>
Anyway I've been up to a few things. First off is I'm almost finished writing my book (book implies a lot of stuff, doesn't it :P) which is about 16 pages long about server administration focusing on Windows. This is for some clients, and the new techs (Sean and Pierre) at IDWS. Once it's finished I'll upload it.&lt;br/>
Also been testing things out in Kylix at home (since VMWare at work on a P3 800 is a joke), for enterprise level stuff. What I am impressed with is that Borland converted the GNU LibC headers across which adds in so much of the the Linux power to Kylix.&lt;Br/>
Last off I've been annoying people with F1 challenge. It is really kewl pretending to Schumacher and doing 347km/h on the straight at Monza! And lastly I now know what type of office I want to work in, it's called the Bionic Office.&lt;br/></description><author>Robert MacLean &lt;robert@sadev.co.za></author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.sadev.co.za/viewblog?id={D0752B20-942D-D811-940D-DC56B9100D0D}</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2003 00:00:01 GMT+2</pubDate></item>

Craig has gone to Cape Town and Tobias has joined the Swiss army (i'm not kidding, he is swiss and it's required that every swiss male do 1 year in the army).&lt;br/>
So I have new people to harass, name Pierre and a guy called Sean (who only starts monday).&lt;br/>
So anyway to Tobias and Craig, big good byes and much best stuff happen to thee in thy future and other nice like things.&lt;br/>
My big news is i'm getting my own place, no more family, at the end of the month!!! How kewl is that!&lt;Br/>
Oh, and to top off my week, I got an email from Tim Willts, who is a designer at ID software. My logic is now I know someone who is working on, or working with someone who is working on Doom 3!!! Yeah, I own and all you suck :)&lt;br/>
And the new website design is looking nice.</description><author>Robert MacLean &lt;robert@sadev.co.za></author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.sadev.co.za/viewblog?id={5C989CFB-932D-D811-94C7-9D6AF54A939F}</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2003 00:00:01 GMT+2</pubDate></item>

anyway I did some house hunting this week and nothing is going too great there. Maybe this week end will be better. Albert dropped off his Microsoft Force Feedback wheel for me to play Race driver with.&lt;Br/>
In terms of coding I'm working out bugs and some new features for Aclean, like stats which is something I really wanted for a while.&lt;br/>
Work wise I've written so many stored procs for sql server this week when I needed to test some things in Delphi I could not figure out why GO wouldn't have the code execute.
One interesting thing I worked with is XSL or XSLT. XSL is basically the CSS of XML. But with a ton more options like sorting of entries etc...&lt;Br/>
It has plenty of possiblities available to it (doing filtering and sorting on the client side of an XML result set) or themes support type stuff. The downside is limited support, until IE 6 there was really buggy support for it. Now imagine trying to force people onto that. It may be viable 2-3 years from now. But unfortunately not yet, which is a great shame.&lt;br/>
For a different view on some things I opened a Deviant art account this week and upload some pics. You can check my portfolio(?) at http://dfantom.deviantart.com.</description><author>Robert MacLean &lt;robert@sadev.co.za></author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.sadev.co.za/viewblog?id={F89B6EDF-932D-D811-863B-B51686EA821A}</guid><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2003 00:00:01 GMT+2</pubDate></item>

I haven't uploaded anything like i said i would (i should next week), mainly cause life is a bitch and keeps screwing my plans to do it.&lt;Br/>
One thing I love to do is read developers blogs and fingers. One of my favorites is Justin Frankel (from Nullsoft and Winamp fame).&lt;br/>
Anyway he killed his blog this week, and now only has a finger. Which left me with a problem, this Windows box don't finger people *evil grin*&lt;br/>
So I wrote a small app to read his finger *childish grin again* as well as some other peoples. You can download it here. If you want to add new people to it, open the .ini file included with it and edit it (you'll need to restart the app though, but it restarts in 0.01 secs so thats not bad). Should be pretty simple.&lt;br/>
If for some reason you can't/don't want to run it, you can also read Justin Frankels finger *theres that childish grin again* at Webdog. The other thing I did was for Fragaholic from the UnrealZA Forums. He asked for a demo of doing a broadcast/chat app (ie user types message, it is sent to every other user on the server). Anyway, I wrote one up. It's not my finest code, it's completely devoid of a naming system and comments aren't there but t's a good example.&lt;br/>
If you are interested in it, you can download the client and the server (pre-compiled) and the full source here. You will need Indy to compile the source.</description><author>Robert MacLean &lt;robert@sadev.co.za></author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.sadev.co.za/viewblog?id={3A1339C5-932D-D811-81BE-C3D1CAC68954}</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2003 00:00:01 GMT+2</pubDate></item>

Anyway my kitten was in to the vet on Tuesday to be spade, but okay now, just weak.&lt;br/>
I'm working on releasing my session management component for delphi (really great for webbroker stuff) with the pic update.&lt;br/>
BTW if you are a space nut, go and check out orbitor. Really rocking space flight sim, and it's free.&lt;br/>
Almost 5pm (less than an hour) and then off to kick some ass at a lan tonight (i'll grab some pics of that as well)!!</description><author>Robert MacLean &lt;robert@sadev.co.za></author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.sadev.co.za/viewblog?id={0A87DD9B-932D-D811-940D-DC56B9100D0D}</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2003 00:00:01 GMT+2</pubDate></item>

I did finish Spinter Cell on Monday and all I can say is cool. It is the very defination of coolness, the moves, the music, alas is baie kewl.&lt;Br/>
Anyway tomorrow is the party for my 21st (actual birthday is on the 16th) and I'm hoping that will be better than this week.&lt;br/>
It's also costing me a fortune which could be used to benefit my favorite charity, me. So I'm hoping for lots of big, shiney things (mental note buy camera batteries).</description><author>Robert MacLean &lt;robert@sadev.co.za></author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.sadev.co.za/viewblog?id={6E9D8867-932D-D811-95AF-9EB035302CB7}</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2003 00:00:01 GMT+2</pubDate></item>

Anyway I did a wish list update and I should have some new pics up and some new code up soon as well.&lt;Br/>
Code is mainly 2 utils I needed when converting all my MP3's to OGG. 1 is a program that finds empty folders and deletes them. Nice one to learn recursion if any one is wonder.&lt;Br/>
The other is used to append the folder name to the front of the file (ie if file x.mp3 is in c:\mp3 then you can make it mp3-x.mp3). This one was because I have a ton of mp3's named trackx.mp3 and was in a folder with the artists name. This one is kewl in that it is great to learn collections (ie TOwnedCollection and TCollectionItem) and threads (TThread).&lt;Br/>
In the other real world the single best restuarant i've ever been to is Lust in Melville, JHB (across from the Baseline). The service, food, atmosphere was all perfect. Expensive but worth it.&lt;Br/>
And lastly this weekend I'm off to another lan. I was at one a few weeks back of their's and it rocked.&lt;br/>
Work on SimpleRSS has slowed since there is not much else I can add to it yet, although AClean, another project I'm working on, just got some nice new things added.</description><author>Robert MacLean &lt;robert@sadev.co.za></author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.sadev.co.za/viewblog?id={5E76912C-932D-D811-940D-DC56B9100D0D}</guid><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2003 00:00:01 GMT+2</pubDate></item>

So with my own upgrade there is also a site update, there are a few new pics in the gallery, the cricket calculator code is finally up and some mp3's.&lt;Br/>
The mp3's are 4 old ones I made about 5 years ago, so if they are trash I'm sorry.&lt;p/>
For the speed freaks out there I did benchmark before and after my upgrade. The results are:&lt;br/>
In SiSoft Sandra 2000 the chipset benchmark:&lt;p/>

    * ALU: Before 271MB/s After: 638MB/s&lt;br/>
    * FPU: Before 281MB/s After: 674MB/s&lt;p/>

In GLExcess 1.1:&lt;Br/>
Before 24444 XSMarks After: 60403 XSMarks&lt;br/>
In 3dMark 2000 1.1&lt;Br/>
Before 9438 3dmarks After: 10623 3dmarks&lt;br/>
And In GLExcess 1.2 (I only downloaded this recently so there is only an after):&lt;br/>
After 6750 XSMarks</description><author>Robert MacLean &lt;robert@sadev.co.za></author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.sadev.co.za/viewblog?id={6022E20F-932D-D811-88FF-DBC25C11FBEE}</guid><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2003 00:00:01 GMT+2</pubDate></item>

It shows off a few more features, and even has an article that was added at design time in the IDE.&lt;Br/>
I got all the categories working late last night, but only after I CVS to sourceforge and made this show off page so there is nothing there about it.&lt;Br/>
Last thing left to do is the ratings :) and the import stuff.

So far all that I haven't got working is:&lt;p/>

    * Categories for Items and the channel&lt;Br/>
    * Channel Rating&lt;br/>

The categories is more a programming problem than anything else, with the rating is my brain don't understand it.&lt;Br/>
I joined the RSS 2.0 mailing list and am hoping someone will send me an example of the ratings thing, then that will be done.&lt;Br/>

I've been looking at it for various reasons, and I've actually design a few apps that are different to the original idea behind it (like a recipe catelogue, qotd system etc...)&lt;Br/>
But those are designs, and not real so to make it real I'm working on a component for delphi to intergrate into it. I even have a sourceforge project page up for it now http://sourceforge.net/projects/simplerss/.&lt;Br/>
My first project with it will be to put a touch of automation into this news section and providing a RSS feed for it.&lt;p/>
Oh and I'm about half way through the main quest in Morrowind, and I'm a weany level 17.&lt;Br/>
I also got American McGee's Alice (which is a computer game, about Alice In Wonderland, except wonderland is evil and it takes place after the original story.) recently which is really rocking in terms of game play.&lt;br/>
There are 2 things I really like&lt;p/>
    * Each weapon is useful throughout the game - There is no super weapon that you use to kill everything from tiny bugs to level end bosses. Each weapon is balanced and some of the bad guys seem to be easier to kill with certain weapons.&lt;Br/>
    * The levels are lovely- It's something I look at a lot in games is levels, and most of these (99%) are excellant. For those who don't know I used to free lance some level design for a few SA game companies, but that was a long time back and all the companies are long dead (wasn't me, honest)</description><author>Robert MacLean &lt;robert@sadev.co.za></author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.sadev.co.za/viewblog?id={64469DAA-922D-D811-940D-DC56B9100D0D}</guid><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2003 00:00:01 GMT+2</pubDate></item>

Home wise I got Mandrake 9.0 up and running, so got a nice duel boot with WinXP Pro.&lt;br/>
I also got Kylix 3 OE going and wrote a quick app to work out run rates, and projected scores for cricket matches. I'll upload it soon, with some new pics of my pets, sister (who coming home tomorrow :D) and hopefully my trip to Golf Reef City on Friday.&lt;Br/>
One thing that needs to improve in Linux is installation support. Oh, the amount of trouble installing programs becomes when you can not find the write module. I know you can just re-compile most programs to work but why should I need to? Decent install tools for Windows have been around for ages, why aren't they on Linux?&lt;br/>
And lastly the thing that has been keeping me busy recently is Morrowind, it is truely amazing. I'm going to upload some pics of my house and make a stats page I can put my current stats on soon.</description><author>Robert MacLean &lt;robert@sadev.co.za></author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.sadev.co.za/viewblog?id={9C3C7473-922D-D811-88FF-DBC25C11FBEE}</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2003 00:00:01 GMT+2</pubDate></item>

Also the menu system is now automated, meaning that every page will have the same menu and that it is dynamic. I wrote the menu system in a small ISAPI dll and the menu itself comes from an INI file.&lt;br/>
Things still to get done are upload my photo album (it's done, just it needs to be brought to work to upload as it is around 10MB), also I'm going to post the source for the menu system and the guest book soon.&lt;br/>
In other news I finally got into some new source forge work. Busy with 2 projects now, AClean and Titanium Server Solution.&lt;Br/>
AClean is very much like the directory cleaner I wrote before except with more options. All I've done so far for it is to write the multi language support.&lt;br/>
Titanium is a new web server, seems like a mix of Apache and IIS to me with support for my favorite thing, ISAPI!!! It's still in planning so not much has been done.&lt;p/>
The Multi language support was easier than I expected, mainly because of the component way I wrote it. I think with a little tweaking I could change it into a stand alone component. If I do I will post it here :)</description><author>Robert MacLean &lt;robert@sadev.co.za></author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.sadev.co.za/viewblog?id={BCAA1B39-922D-D811-81BE-C3D1CAC68954}</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2003 00:00:01 GMT+2</pubDate></item>

Bad news is I did not get around to uploading the changes. So that means it will either tomorrow or over the weekend. Also my personal email is still down (fix all the client and work stuff first), so if you need to get hold of me email me at robmac@ananzi.co.za&lt;p/>
One more thing, I would like to say a big thanks to Igor at PSoft for helping out today even though he is as tired as I am (I've had 5 hours sleep in the last 2 days).</description><author>Robert MacLean &lt;robert@sadev.co.za></author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.sadev.co.za/viewblog?id={20A7620F-922D-D811-87CC-EACC5C248A96}</guid><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2003 00:00:01 GMT+2</pubDate></item>

Okay tomorrow I'll be doing some updates to the site. I'm adding an about me section, a photo gallery and a section for my baby sister's letters (you'll understand tomorrow).
In terms of programming, I've been doing some things. One is called UberFax which is a fax program to send to multiple people. Also I've haven't gotten around to change the guest book so I can publish the code. Will do soon.&lt;br/>
Also I found my SourceForce account so I'm busy trying to get into some projects there.&lt;Br/>
My username at SourceForge is rmaclean, and my profile is available at http://sourceforge.net/users/rmaclean/.
Also I know I said I have another UT2k3 map soon, well I don't. I have the base of the level done (no textures, or meshes). But I honestly can say I'm not interested at the moment, I'm playing Flashpoint, HitMan2 and Kingping right now and don't have time for a game where i can beat a bot silly . I need games with a challendge (can you hear the cry for Deus Ex 2).br/>
Maybe once I start lanning again this year and playing more UT2k3 at lans I'll get inspired to do some more mapping. But right now I don't feel like it.</description><author>Robert MacLean &lt;robert@sadev.co.za></author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.sadev.co.za/viewblog?id={544EC9FA-912D-D811-88FF-DBC25C11FBEE}</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2003 00:00:01 GMT+2</pubDate></item>

Hope it was a good one :) Anyway I have some new things going on. Firstly I finally got my web stats up and running using AWStats. Also you'll see on the left a link to my Guest Book.  It was written completely in Delphi and I'm going to post a small tutorial on how to do one yourself (with source code) soon. Also the colours got a bit of an update to make it a little nicer and finally there are 2 buttons at the bottom of the page, one goes to AddMe.com which I used to register on to some search engines, and the other goes to InkTank which has 2 of the best free online comics available.</description><author>Robert MacLean &lt;robert@sadev.co.za></author><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.sadev.co.za/viewblog?id={962E5EF3-912D-D811-95AF-9EB035302CB7}</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2003 00:00:01 GMT+2</pubDate></item>

Only a few things up at this point, mainly my directory cleaner app, the electronic component database and a few UT2k3 maps.
